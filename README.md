## What is Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF)?
- Delayed Auditory Feedback is a type of experiment where participants hear their own voice with a slight delay while they are speaking
- This feedback loop can cause disruptions in speech production, such as stuttering, speaking more slowly, or changing the pitch of their voice
- DAF is commonly used in research to understand how auditory feedback influences speech production and how the brain adjusts to unexpected delays

## What DAF experiment
- How the brain processes feedback from the voice when it is delayed
- How speech production is affected when feedback does not match what the speaker expects to hear in real-time
- What changes occur in neural activity (e.g., EEG signals) when participants experience this delayed feedback
  
## Features
- audioEnvelope
  - a feature that represents the overall loudness or intensity of the sound over time
  - It smooths out the audio waveform to show how the volume changes as the person speaks. For example, when someone speaks loudly, the envelope will rise, and when they speak softly, it will fall
- audioOnsets
  - The audio onsets refer to the starting points of sounds. Whenever a new sound begins (such as when a person starts a word or syllable), an onset is detected
- eggEnvelope
    - the overall activity of the vocal folds during speech
    - Itâ€™s similar to the audio envelope but focuses on the actual physical movement of the vocal cords as a person speaks
    - EGG is used to measure how the vocal folds open and close when producing speech, and the envelope represents the strength or intensity of this activity over time
  - eggOnsets

## potential suggestions and findings
- Neural Synchronization Hypothesis
  - Increased phase synchronization in the gamma band (30-80 Hz) between auditory and motor cortices will positively correlate with participants' ability to maintain fluent speech under DAF conditions
- Cognitive Load and Frontal Theta Hypothesis
  - The magnitude of frontal theta activity (4-7 Hz) during DAF will predict the degree of speech disfluency, reflecting increased cognitive effort to maintain speech production
- Auditory Cortex Adaptation Hypothesis
  - The amplitude of the N1/P2 components in auditory event-related potentials will increase with longer DAF delays, indicating heightened attention and processing of the altered feedback
- Motor Cortex Compensation Hypothesis
  - Beta band (13-30 Hz) power over the motor cortex will show a greater decrease during DAF compared to normal feedback, reflecting increased motor planning and execution effort
- Mismatch Negativity (MMN) and Feedback Delay Hypothesis
  - The latency of the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) response will increase proportionally with the length of the auditory feedback delay, indicating a direct relationship between delay time and auditory prediction error processing.
- Temporal Response Function (TRF) Adaptation Hypothesis
  - The peak latency in Temporal Response Functions derived from EEG data will shift in proportion to the DAF delay, reflecting the brain's temporal adaptation to altered feedback
- Individual Differences in DAF Susceptibility Hypothesis
  - Participants with higher baseline alpha power (8-12 Hz) in frontal regions will show greater resilience to DAF effects, as measured by maintained speech fluency and reduced ERP changes
- Emotion Regulation and Prefrontal Activity Hypothesis
  - Increased prefrontal alpha asymmetry during DAF tasks will correlate with lower reported frustration levels, indicating more effective emotion regulation in the face of speech disruption
