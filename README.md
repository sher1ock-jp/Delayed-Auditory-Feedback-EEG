## What is Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF)?
- Delayed Auditory Feedback is a type of experiment where participants hear their own voice with a slight delay while they are speaking
- This feedback loop can cause disruptions in speech production, such as stuttering, speaking more slowly, or changing the pitch of their voice
- DAF is commonly used in research to understand how auditory feedback influences speech production and how the brain adjusts to unexpected delays

## What DAF experiment
- How the brain processes feedback from the voice when it is delayed
- How speech production is affected when feedback does not match what the speaker expects to hear in real-time
- What changes occur in neural activity (e.g., EEG signals) when participants experience this delayed feedback
  
## Features
- audioEnvelope
  - a feature that represents the overall loudness or intensity of the sound over time
  - It smooths out the audio waveform to show how the volume changes as the person speaks. For example, when someone speaks loudly, the envelope will rise, and when they speak softly, it will fall
- audioOnsets
  - The audio onsets refer to the starting points of sounds. Whenever a new sound begins (such as when a person starts a word or syllable), an onset is detected
- eggEnvelope
    - the overall activity of the vocal folds during speech
    - It’s similar to the audio envelope but focuses on the actual physical movement of the vocal cords as a person speaks
    - EGG is used to measure how the vocal folds open and close when producing speech, and the envelope represents the strength or intensity of this activity over time
  - eggOnsets

## potential suggestions and findings
1. Neural Synchronization Hypothesis
   1. Explanation: This hypothesis suggests that increased phase synchronization (the degree to which different brain regions’ electrical activities are coordinated in time) between the auditory and motor cortices in the gamma band (30-80 Hz) will positively correlate with participants' ability to maintain fluent speech under DAF conditions. The hypothesis stems from the idea that effective speech production requires tight coordination between the auditory system (which monitors speech output) and the motor system (which controls speech movements).
   2. Neuroscience Background: Gamma band synchronization is linked to high-level cognitive functions like attention and working memory, as well as sensorimotor integration. In the context of speech, gamma synchronization may reflect the brain’s real-time monitoring and adjustment of motor output based on auditory feedback. Studies have shown that gamma activity is involved in coordinating perceptual and motor processes, particularly when precise timing is necessary.
   3. Effectiveness: Given that speech production involves dynamic interaction between auditory feedback and motor planning, increased gamma synchronization during DAF suggests an adaptive mechanism to maintain speech fluency. This is supported by research showing gamma involvement in cross-modal coordination.
   4. Novelty: While gamma synchronization has been widely studied in sensorimotor tasks, applying it specifically to DAF conditions offers a novel perspective on how the brain adapts to feedback perturbations in speech. The hypothesis could reveal new insights into how the brain compensates for altered feedback timing.
2. Cognitive Load and Frontal Theta Hypothesis
   1. Explanation: This hypothesis suggests that frontal theta activity (4-7 Hz) will increase in proportion to speech disfluency under DAF conditions, reflecting increased cognitive effort required to maintain fluent speech. Theta activity is often associated with cognitive control, working memory, and attention, all of which are taxed under DAF as the brain works to correct the delayed feedback.
   2. Neuroscience Background: Theta oscillations, particularly in frontal regions, are closely linked to cognitive processes such as attention and error monitoring. Increased frontal theta activity has been observed in tasks requiring sustained attention and cognitive control, such as speech monitoring under difficult conditions (like DAF). Frontal theta is particularly important in scenarios where cognitive load is elevated due to conflicting sensory information or prediction errors.
   3. Effectiveness: Since DAF disrupts the expected timing of speech sounds, the increased need for cognitive control and correction would be reflected in enhanced frontal theta activity. This hypothesis is highly effective for examining how the brain compensates for disruptions in feedback during speech production.
   4. Novelty: Although frontal theta is well-known in cognitive control studies, its application in DAF research adds a novel dimension to our understanding of how speech-related feedback influences cognitive load. This approach could highlight the brain’s adaptive strategies when dealing with auditory mismatches in real-time speech production.
3. Auditory Cortex Adaptation Hypothesis
   1. Explanation: The hypothesis predicts that as the DAF delay increases, the N1/P2 components of the auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) will become larger, indicating increased attention and processing of the altered auditory feedback. The N1 and P2 components are markers of early auditory processing, with N1 linked to the detection of sound onset and P2 related to higher-order auditory processing.
   2. Neuroscience Background: The N1/P2 complex is a reliable marker of auditory stimulus processing. N1 reflects the brain’s detection of unexpected or novel auditory events, while P2 is thought to reflect more conscious processing or attention to these events. DAF, by altering the timing of feedback, increases the unpredictability of auditory stimuli, which could trigger stronger N1/P2 responses as the brain adapts to the discrepancy between expected and actual feedback.
   3. Effectiveness: Using N1/P2 components to measure how the brain responds to auditory feedback delays is a well-established approach in auditory neuroscience. This hypothesis effectively connects attention-related neural processes to changes in feedback timing during speech production.
   4. Novelty: Although N1/P2 components have been studied extensively in the context of auditory processing, applying them specifically to DAF allows researchers to explore how the brain processes feedback mismatches in a speech-related task. This approach could reveal novel insights into the temporal dynamics of speech monitoring under altered feedback conditions.
4. Motor Cortex Compensation Hypothesis
   1. Explanation: The hypothesis proposes that beta band (13-30 Hz) power over the motor cortex will decrease during DAF compared to normal feedback. Beta band power is often inversely related to motor activity, with decreases in beta power indicating increased motor planning and execution effort. Under DAF, the brain might need to exert more motor control to compensate for the altered feedback.
   2. Neuroscience Background: Beta rhythms are linked to motor control, particularly during the planning and execution of movements. Beta desynchronization (decreased beta power) typically occurs when motor activity increases, suggesting that the brain is in an active state of movement preparation or execution. In DAF, where feedback disrupts the timing of speech movements, increased motor compensation would likely be reflected by a decrease in beta power over motor regions.
   3. Effectiveness: This hypothesis is highly effective for examining how the motor system responds to disruptions in feedback timing. Beta desynchronization is a well-established marker for increased motor effort, making it a useful measure for studying how the motor cortex compensates during DAF.
   4. Novelty: While beta band desynchronization is widely studied in motor tasks, applying it to speech production under DAF conditions is relatively novel. It provides a unique angle on how the motor system adapts to altered auditory feedback, offering insights into motor-auditory integration during speech.
5. Mismatch Negativity (MMN) and Feedback Delay Hypothesis
   1. Explanation: This hypothesis suggests that the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) response will increase in latency as the DAF delay increases. MMN is an ERP component triggered when the brain detects a deviation from an expected auditory pattern, and its latency could reflect how quickly the brain identifies a mismatch between expected and actual auditory feedback.
   2. Neuroscience Background: MMN is a well-established measure in auditory neuroscience for detecting prediction errors in sensory input. It occurs when there is a deviation from an auditory regularity or expectation. The delay in auditory feedback in DAF creates a mismatch between what the speaker expects to hear and what they actually hear, making MMN a suitable tool for investigating the brain's error-detection processes during speech.
   3. Effectiveness: The hypothesis is highly effective because MMN is sensitive to deviations in auditory stimuli, such as those caused by feedback delays. This makes it an ideal marker for assessing how the brain responds to delayed auditory feedback and how quickly it detects the mismatch.
   4. Novelty: The novelty of this hypothesis lies in applying MMN to the temporal dimension of speech production. While MMN is widely used in auditory prediction studies, using it to track feedback delay in speech is a unique approach that could provide new insights into how the brain handles temporal prediction errors in speech.
6. Temporal Response Function (TRF) Adaptation Hypothesis
   1. Explanation: Temporal Response Functions (TRFs) measure how neural activity is modulated by continuous auditory stimuli over time. This hypothesis suggests that as the DAF delay increases, the peak latency of TRFs will shift, indicating how the brain’s response to auditory feedback is delayed and adapted to the altered timing.
   2. Neuroscience Background: TRFs provide a dynamic measure of how neural responses to auditory stimuli evolve over time, making them highly suitable for studying speech-related feedback mechanisms. They are commonly used to examine how the brain processes continuous streams of sound and how it adapts to changes in stimulus timing, such as feedback delays in DAF.
   3. Effectiveness: TRFs are highly effective for capturing the continuous adaptation of brain responses to auditory stimuli. By examining how TRF peak latencies shift with increasing feedback delay, researchers can quantify how the brain's auditory processing adapts over time in response to altered feedback.
   4. Novelty: TRFs have not been widely applied to DAF experiments, making this a novel use of the method. This approach could reveal new insights into how the brain temporally adapts to delayed feedback in speech, potentially offering a new understanding of how the brain handles disrupted timing in continuous auditory processing.
7. Individual Differences in DAF Susceptibility Hypothesis
   1. Explanation: This hypothesis posits that participants with higher baseline alpha power (8-12 Hz) in frontal regions will be more resilient to DAF effects, maintaining more fluent speech. Alpha power is often associated with relaxation, reduced cognitive effort, and disengagement from external stimuli. Higher baseline alpha power may indicate better adaptation to the cognitive and emotional challenges of DAF.
   2. Neuroscience Background: Alpha oscillations are typically associated with states of cognitive relaxation and attentional disengagement. In tasks requiring less cognitive effort or when individuals are better at regulating their attention and emotions, alpha power tends to be higher. Participants with higher alpha power may be better at maintaining fluent speech under DAF because they can more effectively regulate the cognitive load and emotional frustration associated with feedback delays.
   3. Effectiveness: This hypothesis is effective in that it uses a well-known marker of individual differences (baseline alpha power) to predict resilience to DAF-induced disruptions. Alpha power has been shown to reflect individual differences in cognitive processing, making it a suitable measure for exploring variability in DAF susceptibility.
   4. Novelty: While alpha power has been studied in cognitive and emotional regulation, applying it to speech production in DAF tasks is novel. This hypothesis could reveal new links between baseline neural activity and speech fluency, offering insights into why some individuals are more affected by DAF than others.
8. Emotion Regulation and Prefrontal Activity Hypothesis
   1. Explanation: This hypothesis suggests that increased prefrontal alpha asymmetry during DAF tasks will correlate with lower reported frustration levels. Prefrontal alpha asymmetry, typically associated with emotional regulation, reflects differences in alpha power between the left and right prefrontal cortex. Greater leftward asymmetry is often linked to better emotional regulation.
   2. Neuroscience Background: Prefrontal alpha asymmetry is a well-established marker of emotional regulation, with greater leftward asymmetry often reflecting more effective regulation of negative emotions. In DAF tasks, where participants may experience frustration due to delayed feedback, prefrontal alpha asymmetry could reflect how well they manage these emotional responses, potentially influencing their speech fluency.
   3. Effectiveness: This hypothesis effectively connects emotional regulation to speech production, highlighting the role of prefrontal cortex activity in managing the frustration associated with DAF. The use of alpha asymmetry as a marker for emotional regulation is supported by extensive research in affective neuroscience.
   4. Novelty: While prefrontal alpha asymmetry has been studied in emotional regulation, its application to DAF experiments is relatively novel. This hypothesis offers a new way to explore how emotional states, mediated by prefrontal activity, interact with speech production under disrupted feedback conditions.
